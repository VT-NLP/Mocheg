<!-- >ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials -->

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
conda create -n mocheg python=3.8.10
conda install pytorch==1.9.0 torchvision==0.10.0 torchaudio==0.9.0 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- >ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc... -->


## Dataset - MOCHEG

You can download dataset here:

- [MOCHEG version 1](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6653771). 

- Dataset Format and structure are explained in document/MOCHEG_dataset_statement.pdf.


## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [pretrained models](http://nlplab1.cs.vt.edu/~menglong/project/multimodal/fact_checking/MOCHEG/checkpoint/) trained on MOCHEG. 

## Evaluation

To evaluate models on MOCHEG, run:

```eval
bash eval.sh
```
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Training (Optional)

If you want to train models by yourself, run this command:

```train
bash train.sh
```
<!-- 
>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters. -->

## Dataset Build (Optional)

If you want to build dataset by yourself, run this command:

```build_dataset
bash build_dataseth.sh
``` 

<!-- ## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.  -->
